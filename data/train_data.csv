Initially, they concentrated on Western Europe, compiling data related to borders, territories, political affiliations and alliances, natural resources, and conflicts from the end of the Second World War till the start of the 21st century. The data was then analyzed, cross-referenced, and layered to create an evolving map showcasing the changes over time. By 2015, their attention switched to Eastern Europe, mirroring the same detailed approach and focusing on the post-Cold War era. The project was finally completed in 2020, with an interactive timeline representing the geopolitical changes in Europe over the past seven decades.",50,"When did the team start focusing on Eastern Europe's geopolitical data?

930,"In the late 1800s, a group of researchers in a London laboratory were tirelessly working on a promising experiment that aimed to split an atom. Their attempts ultimately resulted in failure until in 1911, in a lab in Manchester, a scientist named Ernest Rutherford rediscovered their findings, corrected some errors and successfully split the atom for the first time. Inspired by this, researchers at Berkeley University in California, USA, picked up from where Rutherford left and engaged in their own atomic studies in the 1930s, resulting in successful development of an atomic bomb by 1945.

1220,"In the year 2121, scientists discovered a peculiar space-time anomaly in the asteroid belt located between Mars and Jupiter. This anomaly, dubbed ‘SCP-001’ allowed instantaneous transfer to any previously visited area on Earth when entered. Testing further, they realized that voyages through SCP-001 also reversed the flow of time by exactly 365 days. A system was established: they would use Mars Orbiter as a base station, send an exploration spacecraft (XR2), first to a specified location on Earth to set the destination, and then through the anomaly. This allowed them to revisit events from the past while staggering investigations to avoid meeting their past selves.",294,"What would happen if the scientists sent spacecraft XR2 through SCP-001 without establishing an Earthly destination first?

A. The spacecraft would disappear permanently. 
B. The spacecraft would arrive randomly on Earth.
C. The spacecraft would not activate SCP-001. 
D. The spacecraft would return to the base station at Mars Orbiter.",D. The spacecraft would return to the base station at Mars Orbiter.,"The story mentions, that the anomaly allows transfer to any previously visited area on Earth when entered.

1540,"In the vibrant art scene of late 19th-century Paris, the burgeoning Impressionist movement was beginning to challenge traditional artistic norms. Simultaneously, in a quiet corner of St. Petersburg, Russia, the Symbolist movement in literature was taking root, creating a counterpoint to the stark realism favored in Russian literature of that time. Forty years later in 1920s New York, artists resonating with the revolutionary spirit of the European Avant-garde began to interweave the threads of these two movements to birth the Synthetist movement, a melding of the vivid, evocative imagery of the Symbolists with the bold, unique palette of the Impressionists. This movement, though initially centered in New York, spread west to Chicago over the ensuing decade.

As time passed, by the dawn of the 20th century, the Modernism Movement brought with it a significant shift the United States, driving creators to break away from traditional genres and forms, opting for more experimental, fragmented works. But the Postmodernism Movement was emerging by the mid-20th century in France, with an emphasis on irony and skepticism, blurring the line between high and low culture in literature and arts. With the advent of the 21st century, Illogicalism in Russia started to dominate the scene, celebrating the absurd and irrational through art and literature. Despite the different origins and epochs, these movements have successfully synthesized to establish an interconnected web of artistic and literary expressions across continents and centuries.",566,"Which movement blurred the line between high and low culture in literature and arts?

2590,"When renowned physicist Dr. Neil Richter discovered multiple anomalies in the space-time continuum, he soon realized it was a loop, causing time to go back 5 hours every time it succeeded 17 hours in his current time zone. In addition, he noticed that every time he was at the position of the anomaly, the space around him would shrink, effectively reducing the distance between points within a 3-mile radius by half. To counteract the anomaly, Neil devised a device called Quantum Normalizer to rectify the simultaneous temporal and spatial distortions. He activated the device at 16:00 hours, one hour before another time reset, at the epicenter of the anomaly. Immediately after activation, the Quantum Normalizer emitted a high-frequency pulse, which gradually eliminated the anomaly, thereby restoring time flow and spatial relations within the 3-mile radius.",568,"If Dr. Neil Richter started his journey at a point 3 miles away from the Quantum Normalizer, how far would he need to travel to reach it during the operation of an anomaly?

After the second teleportation, he found himself stranded in a different timeline—the Jurassic era on Earth. In a turn of events, he narrowly escaped an encounter with a tyrannosaurus rex and successfully returned to his original timeline by manipulating the space-time anomaly.",682,"If Nolan experienced another space-time jump after escaping the T-rex, where would he most likely end up?

b) On Zorgon 97
c) In the Andromeda galaxy
d) Back to the Jurassic era",a) An unknown location and time.,"The anomaly caused Nolan to jump to an unknown location and time in each instance. Should another teleportation occur, it can be inferred that he would end up in another unknown location and time.",6

3697,"In 2005, a group of astronomers working at a research station in the North Pole started observing a series of celestial phenomena that were predicted to occur over the next 10 years. They started with a meteor shower that illuminated the midnight sky of the Arctic region in that year. In 2010, a mysterious comet, named 'Oort's Traveler', was projected to pass by Earth, visible from the South Pole. Following that, in 2015, a long-foreseen solar eclipse was expected to be visible from the equatorial region. As the decade of celestial observations wound down, the astronomers prepared for the final event, the alignment of the planets in 2020, visible from every part of the globe.",789,"From which location was the solar eclipse expected to be primarily visible?
Answer choices
a) North Pole
b) South Pole
c) Equator
d) Every part of the globe",c) Equator,The story specifically says that the solar eclipse was expected to be visible from the equatorial region.,4

Answer choices
a) Arctic region
b) Antarctic region

Answer choices
a) 5 years
b) 10 years
c) 15 years
d) 20 years",a) 5 years,"The text shows that the meteor shower occurred in 2005 and that the comet known as 'Oort's Traveler' was expected in 2010. Therefore, it's a 5-year gap between the two events.",6
